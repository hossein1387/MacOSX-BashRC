# MacOSX-BashRC

##This bash_profile was largely copied from someone that I don't remember his github username! I will add his name and github repo once I found it. If you know who I am talking about, please send me his information m.h.askari.hemmat@gmail.com##

I am using a terminal theme that can be found [here](http://media.tannern.com/tanner.terminal)
With this theme and bash_profile, my terminal looks like this:
